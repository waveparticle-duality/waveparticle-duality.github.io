# Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle 

## Introduction

The concept of uncertainty is often explained as a result of measurement, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle has often been equated to the ‘observer’s paradox’ that the very act of observing a phenomenon causes it to change. This is, however, not exactly accurate. The principle is a direct implication of the dual wave-particle nature of a particle. It was first stated by German physicist Werner Heisenberg back in 1927, stating that it is **impossible to simultaneously know a particle’s position and momentum at the same time**. This can be expressed in the equation $$\Delta x \Delta p = \frac{h}{4\pi}$$. The exact position or momentum of an object has no meaning in quantum mechanics.

## Particles vs waves

Particles only **exist in a single place** at any instant in time (probability of finding a particle is 100% at one specific position and 0% elsewhere). However, they **have no wavelength**, so we can’t find their momentum. Similarly, Waves are spread out in space and **have a wavelength**, hence their momentum can be calculated and analyzed as a whole but **cannot be assigned a single position**.

## Creating a particle with both position and momentum 

To get a better understanding of the uncertainty principle, let’s consider how we can get a particle with both position and momentum. We need to combine the above observations of a wave and a particle, such that we can construct an object that has waves, but only in a small area. When we add two waves, as a result of superposition, we find that there are places where the peaks line up, making a bigger wave, while there are some regions where the peaks and valleys of the wave cancel out each other, resulting in regions where we see nothing at all.

If we keep adding waves, we can make a wave ‘packet’ with a clear wavelength in one small region, resulting in a quantum object with both wave and particle properties, but to accomplish this, **we have to lose certainty about both position and momentum**. The position still isn't restricted to a single point and we can still find the object with a good probability within any point in the ‘packet’. To make the wave ‘packet’, we added waves, which means there's some probability of finding the object with the momentum corresponding to any one of the waves. Both position and momentum are now uncertain.

To reduce the position uncertainty, we can make a smaller wave packet by adding more waves, though this causes a bigger momentum uncertainty. To reduce momentum uncertainty, we need a bigger wave packet and thus causing bigger position uncertainty.
In essence, that’s the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which is not a result of taking measurements, but an inevitable result of the wave-particle duality; a limit on what properties an object can have, built into the fundamental structure of the universe itself.

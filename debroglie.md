# de Broglie's Hypothesis

## Introduction

The de Broglie hypothesis is that, just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, electrons and other particles of matter also have wave-like properties, with $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$, generalizing Einstein’s equation of $$E = hf$$.

De Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later for electrons with the observation of electron diffraction in two independent experiments: passing a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observing the predicted interference patterns, and the Davisson-Germer_experiment where an electron beam was guided through a crystalline grid.

However, ​the wave nature of everyday objects is not observed as fast and heavy objects correspond to extremely small and undetectable wavelengths, and is much more relevant for particles like atoms or electrons.

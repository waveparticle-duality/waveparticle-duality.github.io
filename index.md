# The Wave Theory of Light

Most introductory physics deal with concepts that are tangible to everyday life, we deal with the motion of pendulums and cars, or the collision of particles like atoms. Modelling the behaviour of these human-scale objects has been the task of scientists for centuries and forms the basis of **classical physics**. But also at a human-scale we clearly observe another phenomena, light.


So, how do we model the behaviour of that?

Scientists have studied how light behaves for centuries, but only after these centuries of thought and experiments did most scientists agree on the theory that light is a wave. 

More specifically, light is a form of energy, travelling in waves, like waves in an ocean. Except instead of an ocean the waves exist in both **electric** and **magnetic** fields, which is why light is also called **electromagnetic radiation**. 

This wave theory of light has a few features, most importantly, light has a **wavelength**, and the energy of light is tied to its wavelength. A shorter wavelength has more energy, and a longer wavelength has less energy. As it so happens our eyes detect light of different energies as light of different colors.

These differences in wavelength form the electromagnetic spectrum, and the visible light we see is just a small section of it. Everything else in the spectrum from long-wavelength radio and infrared, to short-wavelength X-rays and gamma rays, exist and we can observe their effects but our eyes can’t detect them.

This theory was explained by many phenomena that scientists observed, like the Arago or Poisson Spot, the [double-slit experiment](doubleslit), and refraction, where light was demonstrated to be able to interfere with itself and exhibit wave behaviour.

At the same time in the 1600s, opposing theories describing light as particles from reputable scientists like Isaac Newton’s corpuscular theory did exist, but with most scientists observing experiments that supported a wave theory, it quickly became apparent that visible light, ultraviolet light and infrared light were all electromagnetic waves with different wavelengths.

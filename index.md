## The Wave Theory of Light

Most introductory physics deal with concepts that are tangible to everyday life, we deal with the motion of pendulums and cars, or the collision of particles like atoms. Modelling the behaviour of these human-scale objects has been the task of scientists for centuries and forms the basis of **classical physics**. But also at a human-scale we clearly observe another phenomena, light.

So, how do we model the behaviour of that?

Scientists have studied how light behaves for centuries, but only after these centuries of thought and experiments did most scientists agree on the theory that light is a wave. 

More specifically, light is a form of energy, travelling in waves, like waves in an ocean. Except instead of an ocean the waves exist in both **electric** and **magnetic** fields, which is why light is also called **electromagnetic radiation**.

This wave theory of light has a few features, most importantly, light has a **wavelength**, and the energy of light is tied to its wavelength. A shorter wavelength has more energy, and a longer wavelength has less energy. As it so happens our eyes detect light of different energies as light of different colors.

These differences in wavelength form the electromagnetic spectrum, and the visible light we see is just a small section of it. Everything else in the spectrum from long-wavelength radio and infrared, to short-wavelength X-rays and gamma rays, exist and we can observe their effects but our eyes can’t detect them.

This theory was explained by many phenomena that scientists observed, like the [Arago or Poisson Spot](arago), the [double-slit experiment](doubleslit), and refraction, where light was demonstrated to be able to interfere with itself and exhibit wave behaviour.

At the same time in the 1600s, opposing theories describing light as particles from reputable scientists like Isaac Newton’s corpuscular theory did exist, but with most scientists observing experiments that supported a wave theory, it quickly became apparent that visible light, ultraviolet light and infrared light were all electromagnetic waves with different wavelengths.

## The Turning Point - Particle Nature of light

Treating light purely as a wave though, had some issues.

<p align="center"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rlM0_kzd-UK5SVddSy5wr-m72u7cxlBQXx_Kpg0sfXuPaxzXSNzQL6oUxpCFD_PztGRjai7Y8u-KAXrVsBurPuenuAvHuwH3HMi7Vb_Sq8UasXScA9sguH2dv8iaAH9NQj40ee4c=s0" alt="img" width="627" height="353"/></p>

Max Planck in 1901 could only explain a well-known phenomenon, [Black Body Radiation](blackbody), by mathematically assuming light needs to be split into **packets of energy** called **_quanta_**. However, after realising he had unintentionally made an atomic theory of light, Planck himself denounced his analysis of light as particles, treating it as a limitation of his approximation and not a truth. Most physicists at the time also agreed that a more complete derivation would have no quantization.

Another famous unsolved phenomenon was the [Photoelectric Effect](photoelectric), where electrons are emitted from a metal when exposed to light. More interestingly, the energy of the ejected electrons depended not on the intensity of light like the wave theory suggested, but rather on the frequency of the light. This observation went directly against modelling light as a wave that can continuously transfer energy, instead, it suggested that light must transfer energy to matter in “packets”. It was in 1905 that Albert Einstein famously took Planck’s black body model to produce a solution to this effect, eventually leading to a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

## Unifying theories - Understanding wave-particle duality

From this point on, scientists could agree that light had both wave-like and particle-like properties. But the reasons behind it was still unknown.

<p align="center"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wCpPx07w0_V5uUzBHUnn11v_-ekW3TOxFy7WUmCLhIfGNsL71rG0yU7RMZwc-ppCumA_EP6lwIWTEJWDBxlDLbTyShVTOarLxj20abl2A7ESjJiD70qEBVkjcg3b8t5MmMPn244C=s0" alt="img" width="627" height="164"/></p>

It was not until De Brogile asked a fundamental question of whether particles like electrons could exhibit wave-like properties in his famous 1924 paper was the final piece of the puzzle solved. After a few experiments that confirmed particles had wave-like properties. It seemed that De Brogile was right. He showed that electrons can behave like waves, but more than that, his derivations suggested that everything in the universe behaved both as a wave and a particle.

De Brogile was awarded the Nobel prize for Physics in 1929. Interestingly, De Brogile had initially intended his career to be in the humanities and received his first degree in history.

## Consequences

The fact that any physical object had wave behaviour is shocking at first, but it could be said that wave-particle duality was the foundation from which all of modern quantum mechanics came about, bringing about [Heisenburg’s Uncertainty Principle](heisenberg), dictating that there is an upper limit to the properties of any object.

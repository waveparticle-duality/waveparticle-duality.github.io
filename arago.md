# Arago Spot

In 1818, the French Academy of Science launched a competition to explain the theory of light. A civil engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel entered this competition with his new wave theory of light. After studying Fresnel’s theory of light, Poisson who was a firm believer that light was made of particles wanted to find a way to disprove Fresnel’s theory. He realized that based on Fresnel’s theory, when parallel beams of light were shone on a circle, there would be a bright spot in the middle of the shadow. This was contrary to many people’s intuition on light, where the shadow of an object should be complete darkness. After all, one does not observe this predicted bright spot in daily life when shadow of balls is cast. Poisson therefore concluded that his thought experiment should have brought an end to Fresnel’s theory and it would have been another win for “team particle”. However the head of committee, Dominique-François-Jean Arago, was not convinced and decided to perform the experiment himself. Amazingly, Arago had observed the bright spot in the middle of the shadow. This experiment ended up convincing more scientists that light indeed showed properties of waves.

Today, this spot is now named the Arago spot, or the Poisson spot, or the Fresnel spot. It shows us 2 things. That light indeed exhibits wave-like properties and that your flash of genius could be your biggest downfall. Poisson’s flash of genius to realize that Fresnel’s theory predicted a bright spot in the middle of a round shadow to disprove Fresnel’s theory ended up convincing more people that Fresnel was right.

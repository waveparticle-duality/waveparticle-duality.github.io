# Photoelectric effect

## Introduction

Discovered in the 1800s by many sources, the photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, hits a material. Except, scientists observed strange behaviour as to how the electrons were emitted. Namely, the fact that only very specific conditions allowed electrons to be emitted. 

The energy of these ejected electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but instead on its frequency. The intensity of this light only affected the amount of electrons ejected, while to get high energy electrons, one must illuminate the metal with high-frequency light.

## Using Planck's energy quanta

If one demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quanta hf, low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing the intensity increases the number of photons, and thus the number and not the energy of excited electrons, because the energy of each photon remains low. By increasing the frequency of the light and thus the energy of the photons, one can eject electrons with higher energy. 

## Relationship of energy and frequency 

The energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency, with the gradient of the line being Planck's constant, famously known with the equation $$E = hf$$. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when Robert Andrews Millikan produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions.

In turn, this demonstrated the particulate nature of light, as the effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incident radiation. Classical theory predicted that the electrons would 'gather up' energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.

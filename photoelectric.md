# Photoelectric effect

## Introduction

Discovered in the 1800s by many sources, the photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, hits a material. Except, scientists observed strange behaviour as to how the electrons were emitted. Namely, the fact that the light shone had to have specific properties for emissions. 

To physicists in the 1900s, these properties were strange as following the typical wave theory of light, they believed that *any* type of electromagnetic radiation should slowly heat up the electrons, vibrating them to the point they escape, emitting electrons. 

By this logic, physicists first hypothesized that **increasing the brightness**, which corresponds to amplitude of the light waves, **should cause the emitted electrons to have more kinetic energy**. Additionally, increasing brightness (amplitude) should also cause more emissions over the same time.

These hypotheses can be understood by treating the incoming light as a wave crashing into the metal which is a dock in our analogy, the electrons in the metal are like beach balls resting on the dock, and when light waves of higher amplitude crash into it, more beach balls should be kicked off and with more speed.

This analogy also explains physicists' other hypothesis, that increasing the frequency of the wave should also cause more emissions as more waves are crashing into the dock over the same time.

However, when physicists put these hypotheses to the test, they instead found:
* **Kinetic energy** of emitted electrons **increases with light frequency**
* **Amount** of emitted electrons **stays the same as frequency increases**
* **Amount** of emitted electrons **increased with light intensity** (amplitude)
* **Kinetic energy** of emitted electrons **stays the same regardless of light intensity**.

These results turned out to go against most of their hypotheses! To explain these, an entirely new model of light was needed.

Albert Einstein in 1905 would famously apply Max Planck’s black body model to this problem, proposing that light sometimes behaves as **particles of electromagnetic energy**, and these particles were eventually named **photons**.

Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 partly for his work on theoretical physics, but especially for his discovery of these laws of the photoelectric effect.

## Using Planck's energy quanta

So what exactly did Einstein propose?

By demanding that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in packets of energy 
$$E=hf, h=Planck's constant, f=frequency$$
light can be treated as a stream of these packets called photons, where each photon may get absorbed by a corresponding electron, giving energy for the electron to be emitted.

Increasing intensity increases the number of photons, so more electrons absorb the energy and can be emitted. Hence, increasing intensity increases amount of electrons emitted.

Low-frequency light will only eject low-energy electrons as each electron only absorbs one photon and gains its energy. Higher frequency light means each photon has higher energy, so electrons absorb more and are emitted with higher kinetic energy. 
Hence, increasing frequency increases the emitted electrons’ energy

More interestingly, scientists observed that if the incident light had a lower frequency than a specific threshold frequency $$f_{o}$$ no electrons are emitted regardless of how bright the light was. This $$f_{o}$$ turned out to be specific to each metal type.

These results were not confirmed until 1915, when Robert Andrews Millikan produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions.

In turn, this demonstrated the particulate nature of light, as the effect was impossible to understand in terms of a classical wave description of light. 


If one demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quanta $$hf$$, low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing the intensity increases the number of photons, and thus the number and not the energy of excited electrons, because the energy of each photon remains low. By increasing the frequency of the light and thus the energy of the photons, one can eject electrons with higher energy. 

## Relationship of energy and frequency 

The energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency, with the gradient of the line being Planck's constant, famously known with the equation $$E = hf$$. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when Robert Andrews Millikan produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions.

In turn, this demonstrated the particulate nature of light, as the effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incident radiation. Classical theory predicted that the electrons would 'gather up' energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.
